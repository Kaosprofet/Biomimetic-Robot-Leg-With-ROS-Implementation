# Robotic-leg
Repository for Bachelor group E2103 at NTNU. We are 4 Automation and Robotics students building a test system for a 4 DOF robotic leg. This Repository will include; Arduino code for embeded controllers, our ROS workspace and URDF model, and MATLAB code for calculations such as IK.<br />
The 4 joints are actuated by Brushed-DC motors <br />
Joint states are kept track of by incremental encoders witch comunicates with embeded controller on I2C bus<br />
Embeded controller is Arduino Mega running as a ROS Serial Node<br />
